# Project Reflection
This project was a great experience and exercise. I dug into the field of graph/tree visualizations algorithms and explored a variety of approaches. These include force-directed layouts, hyperbolic focus + context and radial trees. The direction I took with this project was an adaptation/improvement on radial trees. With radial trees, tree data is presented in expanding circles from the root of the tree. My implementation relies on outward expanding ellipses instead, since modern screens are rectangular in nature. This allows my implementation to be fundamentally responsive from large landscape desktop screens to small portrait mobile devices. Not only did I gain knowledge in a new field of algorithms in Computer Science, I also improved my Javascript & Web scripting ability. My primary work experience is in server-side Java & C++, so this hands on front-end/UI experience was excellent and refreshing. In terms of production usage, this library could be utilized in a web-based decision support system. Typically, these systems present a series of questions and answers in a tree-like fashion. This implementation would handle rendering the information in a fast, efficient and responsive manner.
